# MovieTracker

## Scenario

I am a movie lover and I would like to be able to keep track of a movie I have watched or seen already. I should be able to search for movies by who appeared in the movie, who made or published the movie, and of course by genres to which the movies belong to. I would like to keep track of how others have rated the movie such IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and I must be able to personally rate the movie only once. I would like to keep a record of all the movies I have watched so that it can be saved as a personal collection to keep up with other movie lovers. 


### Recommended Requirements
-	NodeJS v10+ (https://nodejs.org/en/)
-	PHP 7.2+ 
-	MySQL 5.7+
-	Note: WAMP is recommended to serve as a local server if not hosted online (http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
    -   If WAMP is used, set the port used by Apache to `3001`


## Instructions

### Compile Instructions
-	Open a terminal/command prompt inside the `Code` folder
-   Use the command `npm i` to install all required dependencies
-	Use the command `npm run build` to generate a build folder
    - Remove the line  `"postbuild": "node ftp.js"` from `package.json` if you don't need to automatically ftp after building
    - View [FTP-Deploy](https://github.com/simonh1000/ftp-deploy) for more information
-	Use the command `npm run start` to start testing the app locally
    - Create an empty file called `devserver` in the root `movietracker` folder for local testing

### Hosting Instructions

-   Change the `"homepage"` property in `package.json` to reflect the intended url structure
-	Copy the contents of the build folder into the root of the intended hosting server. E.g. `/www/MyWebsite/`
-	Copy the API folder and place it in the same website folder as before E.g. `/www/MyWebsite/api`
-   Copy the config folder and place it in the same website folder as before E.g. `/www/MyWebsite/config`
    - Rename `config/renametoindex.php` to `config/index.php`
-	Copy the secure folder and paste it outside of the root web folder so that it can‚Äôt be browsed to by the user.  E.g. paste in the server root as `/secure` with `/www`
    - Modify the `app_root.php` in the `api` folder to point the api to the root of the secure folder.

- Folder Structure should look similar to this:

```
üìÅ MyWebsite
‚î£ üìÅapi 
‚î£ üìÇconfig
‚îÉ ‚îó üìúindex.php
‚î£ üìúEverything else from the build folder
```

## Other Notes

### Hosting on Apache

- If you're hosting this as a subfolder of a domain E.g. `MyWebsite.com/movietracker`, you'll need to configure your .htaccess file in that folder to allow it to serve the correct index.html even on a fresh page load.

  E.g.

  ```apache
  <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
      RewriteEngine On
      RewriteBase /
      RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
      RewriteRule . /movietracker/index.html [L]
   </IfModule>
   
  ```
