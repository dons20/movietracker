# MovieTracker

## Scenario

I am a movie lover and I would like to be able to keep track of a movie I have watched or seen already. I should be able to search for movies by who appeared in the movie, who made or published the movie, and of course by genres to which the movies belong to. I would like to keep track of how others have rated the movie such IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and I must be able to personally rate the movie only once. I would like to keep a record of all the movies I have watched so that it can be saved as a personal collection to keep up with other movie lovers.
